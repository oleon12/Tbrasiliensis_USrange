# Data

The main data used in this article is [Occurences_Tb_TempPeriods_FINAL.csv](https://github.com/oleon12/Tbrasiliensis_USrange/edit/main/Data/Occurences_Tb_TempPeriods_FINAL.csv); the other file is just a variation. This CSV file contains different columns with the following information:

- **Identification:** The identification of each record, including the GBIF ID number (*ID*) and the species name (*Sp*).
- **Space:** The coordinate columns in decimal format (*Lon*, *Lat*), along with the country (*Country*), and the specific region (East, West, and Middle U.S.) where each point overlaps (*Region*).
- **Time:** The date when the record was taken. This includes *Date*, *Year*, *Month*, and *Day*. Likewise, it includes the time period or decade of each point (*cat*), which is also represented by a sequence of numbers (*cat2*).
- **Temperature:** All temperature variables used in the study. The average annual temperature for each year (*TempAvgY2*), the average temperature of the warmest months (*Temp.AvgW2*), and the coldest months each year (*Temp.AvgC2*). Furthermore, the same information extracted for each pixel given the coordinates of each point (*TempAvgY*, *TempAvgW*, and *TempAvgC*).
