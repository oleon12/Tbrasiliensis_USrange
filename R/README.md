# R-scripts

here you'll find all the R-scripts used in the study. 

1. Get_Temp_Final.R: This script reads a stacked raster file containing daily mean temperatures from 1895 to 2024. It calculates three annual temperature metrics: the overall average, the average for the coldest months, and the average for the warmest months. Finally, the script extracts the values of these three temperature variables for each occurrence record, based on the year of the record.
